    Hans Moravec, remember his paradox
    Two Brain Systems?
        Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow @(Daniel Kahneman)
        """System 1""": Fast, automatic, subconcios, emotional,
            Processing faces
            Detect hostility on a face or in a voice
            Orient the source of a sudden sound
            Answer 2+2
            Read words on large billboards
            Drive on an empty road
        """System 2""": Slow, effortful, logical, calculating, concious
            Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room
            Search memory to identify a melody
            Count the occurrencess of the letter 'a' on a page
            compare 2 washing machines for overall value
            Fill out a tax form
            Check the validity of a complex logical argument
    In this class
        >>> More coding for Part 1 assignments correlates to more points and effort. This is a frontloaded course.

    # Agents
    #################################################################
    """Agents""": Anything that can be viewed as percieving (precepts) its environment through """sensors""" and acting upon that environment through """acuators""".
    EXAMPLE: Vacuum Agent
        Percepts:
            Location
            Status [i.e. dirty, clean]
        Actions:
            Move Left
            Move Right
            Suck
            Nop
        function Vacuum-Agent(location, status) return """action"""
            if status == dirty:
                return suck
            elif location = A
                return Right
            elif location = B
                return Left
    #################################################################
    # Rational Agents
    #################################################################
    For each possible percept sequence, a """rational agent""" should select an action that is expected to maximize its """performance measure""" given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and the agent''s built in knowledge.
    """Performance Measure"""(Utility function)
        An objective criterion for success of an Agent'' behavior
    """Expected Utility"""
        EU(action)=sigma.outcome(P(outcome | action) union (outcome))
    !!! Can a rational agent make mistakes?
        This is a question for the midterm
        specification of question could be wrong
        unknown or unforseen variables
    Back to the vacuum agent:
        Is this agent rational?
            Not really. Once sections are cleaned, it will continue to move back and forth.
            Code will break if more sections are added or taken away.
            Would need to determine if a cell could become dirty again
            Doesn''t really have a untility function
            Would need to determine performance measure

    """Fully Observable"""  vs.     """Partially Observable"""

    """Known"""             vs.     """Unknown"""
    
    "Fully observable vs Partially observable"
        Do the Agen''t sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment?        
    "Deterministic vs Stochastic"
        Is the next state of the environment completely determined by the current state and the agent''s action?
            """Strategic""": The environment is deterministic except for the actions of the other agents.
    "Episodic vs. Sequential"
        Is the Agent''s experience divided into unconnected episodes or is it a coherent sequence of observations and reactions?
    "Static vs. Dynamic"
        Is the world changing while the agent is thinking? ///do
            """Semidynamic""": The environment does not change with the passageof time, but the agent''s performance score does.
    "Discrete vs. Continuous"
        Does the environment provide a fixed number of distinct percepts, actions, and environment states?
            Time can also evolve in a discrete or continuous fashion.
    "Known vs. Unknown"
        Are the rules of the environment (transitions and rewards) known to the agent?
            Strictly speaking, not a property of the environment, but the agent''s state of knowledge.
    !!! MIDTERM QUESTION: Identifying and categorizing different environments based on type
        Examples:
            Word Jumble Solver:
                Fully Observable  or     Partially Observable? --->     Fully Observable
                Deterministic     or     Stochastic?           --->     Deterministic
                Episodic          or     Sequential?           --->     Depends on what you define as an action, but ultimiately Episodic
                Static            or     Dynamic?              --->     Static
                Discrete          or     Continuous?           --->     Discrete
                Single-agent      or     Multi-agent?          --->     Single Agent
             Chess with a Clock on Software:
                Fully Observable  or     Partially Observable? --->     Fully Observable
                Deterministic     or     Stochastic?           --->     Deterministic
                Episodic          or     Sequential?           --->     Sequential
                Static            or     Dynamic?              --->     Semi-Dynamic
                Discrete          or     Continuous?           --->     Discrete
                Single-agent      or     Multi-agent?          --->     Multi-Agent
            Scrabble:
                Fully Observable  or     Partially Observable? --->     Partially Observable
                Deterministic     or     Stochastic?           --->     Stochastic
                Episodic          or     Sequential?           --->     Sequential
                Static            or     Dynamic?              --->     Static
                Discrete          or     Continuous?           --->     Discrete
                Single-agent      or     Multi-agent?          --->     Multi Agent
            Autonomous Driving:
                Fully Observable  or     Partially Observable? --->     Partially Observable
                Deterministic     or     Stochastic?           --->     Stochastic
                Episodic          or     Sequential?           --->     Sequential
                Static            or     Dynamic?              --->     Dynamic
                Discrete          or     Continuous?           --->     Continuous
                Single-agent      or     Multi-agent?          --->     Multi Agent
    >>> If stochastic, is it always dynamic?
        No, think of die rolls, where the world doesn''t change between moves
    >>> To an extent, continous (vs. discrete) environments must be represented as discrete within a system, but the environment itself is still continuous.
