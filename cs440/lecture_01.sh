    What is AI?
        """Think like a human"""
        """Act like a human"""

    Turing Test
        A computer needs """THESE""" for successful turing test:
            Natural language processing
            Knowledge Representation
            Automated Reasoning
            Machine Learning
    """Loebner Prize"""
    """Eugene Goostman"""
        June (2014), passed Turing Test
    
    Turing Test """Criticisms"""
       Variability in protocols and judges
        Success depends on deception
        chatbots can do well using "cheap tricks"
            "Changing the conversation"
            "echoing back lines like a psychologist"
                """Eliza""" (1966)
        """Chinese Room Argument"""
            It is possible to have the appearence of intelligence without being intelligent (philosophical criticism).
    A Better Turing Test?
        ' A multiple choice test consisting of questions easily answered
        by humans, but that cannot be answerd by machines using 'cheap tricks''
        Example
            The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase beacuase it was so small. What was so small?
                (a) The suitcase?
                (b) The trophy?
        """Advantages:"""
            Tests can be administered and graded by a computer
            Does not depend on human subjectivity
            Does not require the ability to generate english sentences
            Questions cannot be evaded using verbal dodges: "cheap tricks"
            questions can be made "google-proof"

    #####################################################################
    # Thinking Rationally
    #####################################################################
    Idealized or "right" way of thinking
    """Logic"""
        Patterns of argument that always yield correct conclusions when supplied with correct premises
    """Logicist approach to AI"""
        Describe the problem in formal logical notation and apply general deductin procedures to solve it.
    """Problems with Logicist approach"""
        Computational complexity in finding a solution
        Describing real-world problems and knowledge in logical notation
        Dealing with uncertainty
        A lot of "rational" behavior has noting to do with logic
            reflexes
            folkways
            some mores

    # Acting Rationally ---> THE FOCUS FOR THIS COURSE
    #####################################################################'
    A """Rational Agent""" acts to optimally acheive goals
    Goals are application dependent and expressed in terms of the """utility of outcomes"""
    Being Rational means """Maximizing your (expected) utility"""
    This definition of rationality only concerns the decisions/actions that are made/executed , !'NOT'! the underlying cognitive processes involved.
    In practice, utility optimization is subject to the agent''s computational constraints
        """Bounded rationality"""
            or
        """Bounded optimality"""
    
    """Utility Maximization Formula"""
        """Advantages"""
            Generality:
                goes beyond explicit reasoning and even human congnition altogether
            Practicality:
                can be adapated to many real world problems
            Naturally accomodates uncertainty
            Amenable to good scientific and engineering methodology
            Avoids philosophy and psychology
        """Disadvantages"""
            Difficult to formulate utility functions
                How to be a good chatbot?
                How to autopilot a helicopter?
            leaving off important variables in utility function
                solving food distribution:
                    is it efficient?
                    is it fair?
                    is it safe?
            Limited applicability to humans
                "Humans aren't all rational" - Lazebnik
                Humans are loss averse
                    "I will give you 10 dollars but take away 5" <
                    "I will give you 5 dollars."
