    # Historical Themes
    #################################################################
    Boom and Bust Cycles
        Periods of ('unjustified') optimism followed by periods of disillusionment and reduced funding
    (2013) """Silver Bulletism""" @(Levesque)
        "The tendency to believe in a silver bullet for AI, coupled with the belief that previous beliefs about silver bullets were hopelessly naive."
    Image Problems
    """AI Effect"""
        As soon as a machine gets good at performing some task, the task is no longer considered to require much intelligence.
    AI as a threat?
        Stephen Hawking
        Elon Musk
    """Moravec's Paradox"""
        (1988)
            "It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performence on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perceptions and mobility." - Hans Moravec
        Why is this?
            Human skills are complimentary to computer skills
            Sequential problems vs. open-ended or ill-defined optimal solutions
            Sensorimotor skills 'is to' Millions of years of evolution : Abstract thought 'is to' Relatively recent human development
            Early AI research focused on tasks found difficult and/or interesting to researchers, thereby overlooking infantile and animalisitic abilities.
            We are at least concious of what our minds do best
